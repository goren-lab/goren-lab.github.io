<h1>Welcome to the Goren Lab</h1>
<p>
The Goren Lab is located at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). We are part of the Department of Medicine's Division of Genomics & Precision Medicine. We are members of the <a href="http://bioinformatics.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (BISB)</a> and the <a href="http://biomedsci.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Biomedical Sciences (BMS)</a> programs, the <a href="http://igm.ucsd.edu/about/index.shtml" target="_blank">Institute for Genomic Medicine (IGM)</a> and <a href="https://moorescancercenter.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Moores Cancer Center</a>.

<h2>What do we do?</h2>
Our interdisciplinary research focuses on epigenomic mechanisms and their dynamics. To this end, we merge basic biology, technological innovations and computational analyses. We are mainly interested in developmental-epigenomic questions, and study chromatin in uncharted settings. We investigate and characterize the epigenomic organization and the roles chromatin regulators (CRs) play during mammalian early development and along the cell cycle.
Here is <a href="https://bit.ly/3URKVmM" target="blank">a UCTV video</a> about our work on the role histone modifications play in mitosis.
